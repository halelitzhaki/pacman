**Upgraded Pacman** is a modern reinterpretation of the classic arcade game, developed using Unity3D and C#.
This version introduces a unique mechanic: every 5 seconds, Pacman becomes a magnet and attracting half of the remaining pac-dots on the board.
This project is based on the [Pacman clone by Volkan Ilbeyli](https://github.com/vilbeyli/Pacman), with enhancements to the core processes.

## Features

- **Magnetic Pacman**: Every 5 seconds, Pacman transforms into a magnet, drawing in half of the remaining pac-dots, adding a strategic layer to the gameplay.
- **Classic Gameplay**: Navigate mazes, collect pac-dots, and evade ghosts in the traditional Pacman style.
